This is an attempt to learn c++ using the game of life.

In order to use this distribution of the game of life
you must use the following distributions:

googlemock (version 1.6.0)
googletest (version 1.6.0)
boost (1.47.0)
ncurses (5.9)

There are two distinct classes not under test:
1) LineRenderer which hides classes I could not
figure out how to mock.  Mainly this is to deal with
ncurses which I cannot mock.
2) Main which is primarly a spike.  I have classes I
could pull out but I wanted to see if stuff really
worked!

To run compile and ./GameOfLife -help which will 
give you the options and how to play.
